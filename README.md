# PSY368 Educational Psychology (Fall 2025) — IBA Karachi

This repository contains the course resources I collected for **PSY368 Educational Psychology** at the **Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi** in **Fall 2025**. The course introduces theories, research, and methods in educational psychology, focusing on cognitive and social mechanisms of learning and how they translate to classroom practice.

Note on completeness: I initially enrolled in this course and attended some classes, but later switched to another course. So this repo is a curated set of the materials I had access to (outlines, readings, lectures, and assignment prompts), not a full “taken-through-the-semester” notebook.
